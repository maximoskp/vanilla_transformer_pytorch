# vanilla_transformer_pytorch
A vanilla encoder-decoder base in pytorch, for experimentation. The main branch is intended to remain in vanilla form and branches from that should include the experimental variations.

Mainly followed this code:

But tried to maintain the structure of:

DONE:
- Vanilla implementation
- Implement model-encoder-decoder transformer.

TODO:
- Test vanilla with real data.
- Locking decoder.
- Constraint-mask decoder.
- Split-dictionary encoder-decoder.
